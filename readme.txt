Code for the paper "Optimal Policies Tend To Seek Power" to output the power of small graphs (states < 7). 

This is a Mathematica project, meaning the files (notebooks) will not show their code or function unless you pull them up in Mathematica.

First run "runTheseFunctionsFirst.nb" to load in all the functions. If you're new to Mathematica, you run a file with shift-enter or by clicking "Evaluation" at the top, then "run".

"example.nb" shows an example of creating a graph and outputting it's power. You can use this as a template to create different graphs. You can also output the measure, frequency vectors, non-dominated paths, and more by changing the arguments in the powerOfGraph function.
